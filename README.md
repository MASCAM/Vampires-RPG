# Vampires-RPG

This project was accomplished as a part of the algorithm and computer programming discipline at the University of Brasilia in november 2017. It's a simple RPG game on which you control a vampire in a 2D map fighting against enemies. There's also items on the ground that you can pick up, which are labeled by W for weapons, A for armor and P for potions. Your caracter is labeled by @ and your enemies are V, the boss is shown by the letter D. The game controls are shown in-game.

To run it you must open the archives folder on linux terminal and write the following command lines:

gcc -c main.c

gcc main.c -o main

./main

If you want to run it on Windows just run it on Code Blocks.
